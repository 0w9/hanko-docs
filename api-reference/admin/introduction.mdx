<Note>
  The Hanko Admin API is a paid feature and must be enabled explicitly. You also
  need an API key secret to access the Hanko Admin API. You can generate one
  under the `Settings/API Keys` section of your project.
</Note>

This minimal example showcases how you can get user data using Admin API from the userID obtained from the JWT.

```js
const getUserData = async () => {
  const adminAPIURL = process.env.ADMIN_API_URL;
  const adminAPIKey = process.env.ADMIN_API_KEY;
  const options = {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${adminAPIKey}`,
    },
  };

  const response = await fetch(`${adminAPIURL}/users/${userID}`, options);

  return response.json();
};

const userData = await getUserData();
console.log("user data:", userData);
```
