Session duration determines how long a user remains logged in after authenticating. By default, the session duration is set to 1 hour in the Hanko Cloud Console. You can change that to a value between 1 minute and 1 month to suit your application's needs.

To change the session duration, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.

2. Navigate to `Settings > Authentication > Session Duration`.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/cloud-console/session-duration.png"
    alt="Session duration"
    width="500"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

3. Set the desired session duration and click `Save`.
