This guide will walk you through the process of sending your own emails instead of relying on Hanko's default email delivery.

## Create a Webhook

Create a webhook with the event `email.send`. This webhook will be triggered whenever an email needs to be sent.

<Note>
  If you have not created a webhook yet, please refer to the
  [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks) guide.
</Note>

## Disable Email delivery by Hanko

1. Log in to the [Hanko Cloud Console](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Email`.
3. Disable the Email delivery by Hanko.

Once disabled, Hanko will no longer send any emails on your behalf.

## Send your own emails

When an email needs to be sent, the `email.send` webhook event will be triggered, providing you with all the necessary data to send your own email. The webhook payload will include the following information:

```json
{
  "subject": "",
  "body_plain": "",
  "body": "",
  "to_email_address": "",
  "delivered_by_hanko": true,
  "accept_language": "",
  "type": "passcode",
  "data": {
    "service_name": "",
    "otp_code": "",
    "ttl": 1000,
    "valid_until": 1000
  }
}
```

* `subject`: The subject line of the email.
* `body_plain`: The plain text version of the email body.
* `body`: The HTML version of the email body.
* `to_email_address`: The recipient's email address.
* `delivered_by_hanko`: Indicates whether the email was delivered by Hanko (true) or not (false).
* `accept_language`: The preferred language for the email content.
* `type`: The type of the email being sent (e.g., "passcode").
* `data`: Additional data specific to the email type.

The `data` property in the webhook payload provides type-specific data that can be used to personalize the email further. The structure of the `data` property varies depending on the `type` of the email being sent.

For example, if the email type is "passcode", the `data` property will include the following fields:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="passcode">
        ```json
        "service_name": "",
        "otp_code": "",
        "ttl": 1000,
        "valid_until": 1000
        ```

        |property|description|
        |----|----|
        |`service_name`|The name of the service set in the console as project name|
        |`otp_code`|The passcode the user can use to log in|
        |`ttl`|The validity duration of the passcode in seconds|
        |`valid_until`|The Unix timestamp indicating when the passcode expires|
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Using the provided webhook data, you can compose and send the email to the user using your preferred email service provider or custom email infra.
